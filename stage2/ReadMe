For this stage, a duty cycle is controlled using the x-axis of a joystick. 
In order to accomplish this, another characteristic of GPIO pins need to be set, ADC mode, in order to receive the values
of the position of the joystick according to a voltage.

For this stage new files are added to mylib folder:
* s4344046_joystick.c
* s4344046_joystick.h

Refer to those files in order to see which pins are set in ADC mode and how those values are read from the joystick.
